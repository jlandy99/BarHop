# BarHop

### Purpose
BarHop is an iOS application that allows users to preemptively elect to skip the lines to get into participating bars/clubs on busy nights.

### Technologies Used
BarHop is a native iOS application written in Swift 4.2. Through AWS DynamoDB to perform real-time saves, queries, scans, and updates on user and venue information, and Braintree server-side payments via credit card and Venmo through a Node.js server deployed on Heroku, the user experience is both quick and secure.
