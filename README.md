# BarHop

### Purpose
BarHop is an application that allows users to pay in advance to skip the lines at local bars. The earlier a user selects to receive priority, the cheaper the pass is.

### Technologies Used
BarHop is an iOS application that uses primarily Swift 4.2. However, through AWS and Stripe, multiple backend softwares will be used in order to effectively and securely transfer confidential user data.
