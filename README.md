# BarHop

### Purpose
BarHop is an iOS application that allows users to preemptively elect to skip the lines to get into participating bars/clubs on busy nights.

### Technologies Used
BarHop is an iOS application that uses primarily Swift 4.2. However, through AWS, user data will be confidentially transferred and stored, and with Venmo SDK, users will have ease of payment through a brief cross-platform interaction.
